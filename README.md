# Computist: powerful Python data analysis framework


## What is it?

**Computist** is a Python framework designed with the goal of providing a powerful environment to conduct data analysis quickly and thoroughly.

Large parts of the Computist framework is copied from Recon-ng [1], which is a completely modular framework to conduct reconnaissance quickly. Updates to the framework mainly changes the purpose from reconnaissance to data analysis. It handles preprocessing and analysis of an in-memory Pandas dataframe. Other changes involves adding multiprocessing functionality and smaller fixes in the code to run on Windows.

## Roadmap

The roadmap is mostly dependent on current research interest and needs. However, the goal is to maintain the source code with new modules, functionality, bug fixes and become more independent from the Recon-ng framework.

- Create a Developer Guide for information about building and maintaining modules.
- Create a Wiki tutorial demonstrating usage and highlighting benefits.
- Add new modules for data preprocessing and other functionality.
