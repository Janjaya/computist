# Computist: powerful Python data analysis framework


## What is it?

**Computist** is a Python framework designed with the goal of providing a powerful environment to conduct data analysis quickly and thoroughly. It handles preprocessing and analysis of an in-memory Pandas dataframe. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Janjaya/computist/wiki) for installation instructions and guides to get started.

## Roadmap

The roadmap is mostly dependent on current research interest and needs. However, the goal is to maintain the source code with new modules, functionality, bug fixes and become more independent from the Recon-ng framework (see [Background](#background)).

- Create a Wiki tutorial demonstrating usage and highlighting benefits.
- Add new modules for data preprocessing and other functionality.


## Contributing

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

It is easy for even the newest of Python developers to contribute to Computist. See the [Development guide](https://github.com/Janjaya/computist/wiki/Development-guide) for more information on building and maintaining modules.


## Background

Large parts of the Computist framework is copied from Recon-ng [1], which is a completely modular framework to conduct reconnaissance quickly.
